## Catalogue-Of-Statisctics

In this project, I developed a front-end web application, catalogue of Cryptocurrencies using [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/) 
to collect the data from my React Application.

The application features include:

Listing all Crypto that is worth more than 1$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 10$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 50$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 100$.
Display an error if a connection to the API is not established.
Dynamic routes for individual coin item and display price stats for the last 15 days.
